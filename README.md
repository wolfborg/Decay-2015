### Decay
Developer: Derek Chaplin
Description: A superhero decision-based text adventure game written in Haskell.

This game will be heavily affected by choice but will also have aspects of it which will be set randomly such as certain choices you're given or certain characters you meet. So the game will be able to use some randomization to setup the game and then the player will make choices and certain choices/actions can trigger even more randomization. With this, the game could potentially be a unique story whenever you play again no matter what you choose.

If that explanation still confuses you, imagine this:
You load up Decay and you're greeted with the menu.
You start the game and you're put in City A.
You're given a decision to make, Choice 1A, which will branch the game.
You make a decision and elements of the game are affected.
You continue until you're given Choice 2A.
You repeat this process until you finish the game.

But then decide you liked the game and choose to play it again.
This time, however, you're put in City B to start (which is decided before you even choose anything).
You're given you're first choice, Choice 1D.
You make a decision and the game branches.
The process repeats until the end of the game.

Notice how in the second story you weren't given the same choice either. My goal with this game is to create a better decision-based game than those out there currently which I find to be too linear and that just change small things like dialog. Notice also how being in City B of the second run didn't mean you only got choices B, it grabbed a choice from a set group of choices at random. This slight randomness will help to make the story to be unique each time you play. 

And on top of all of this I would set the game so that not only are choices you given affected, but also other characters that are in your game, items (if any), and villains/enemies.
